Startup Studio* is a cross-listed course offered jointly by Engineering and Business 
that brings together senior students from software engineering, computer science and 
business,  to explore and leverage AI to power innovative product ideas. In 
multidisciplinary teams, students engage in hands-on prototyping, market exploration, 
customer discovery, and human-centered design to tackle real-world opportunities or 
challenges, and create value. Throughout the course, teams are guided by world-class 
founders and industry mentors who bring deep experience in startup development, product 
design, and emerging technologies. The course aim is for multi-disciplinary teams to 
create launch-ready startups. Students will gain practical experience with modern AI tools, 
agile collaboration, and the early stages of startup thinkingâ€”leaving with a product demo, 
a pitch, a lean business canvas, and insights into building responsible and impactful technology.   

*Note this course was formerly called Startup Programming - we have renamed the course to
